# What to do in case of a penguin attack?

Penguin attacks are unlikely, if unprovoked. Should you provoke a penguin attack, however, the best course of action is to lie down. 

This will not stop the attack, but the penguin may kill you much quicker and much more painless. 

If a penguin attacks you without provocation, you may be eligible for compensation (that is, if you survive the attack, which is unlikely). For more information, call 1-800-555-23452938457892748972438957892758979824359872398457892347589023748957943825 and ask for "Olga". If anyone actually picks up, don't tell them where you got this number.
