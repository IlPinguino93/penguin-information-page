Pingu tries to keep a neutral view of the human question, albeit the humans' recent behavior made this highly difficult. 

And yes, he starred in a TV show as a chick. He can't stand to hear humans trying to imitate the "Noot Noot" call anymore, so don't. The last time he encountered a human who did cost us a billion in damages. Did you know how hard it is to replace a humans spine, genitals AND liver?
