# Penguin Information Page

This is just a little project I've created while learning Jekyll. If you'd like to use it, feel free. 

## Disclaimer

I assume no responsibility for the case that penguins actually take over the world. Besides, they can't do much worse than humans, can they?

## Usage

If you actually want to put this into production, here's how. As for why, I can't help you with that.

1. Clone
2. rvm use
3. gem install bundler && bundle install
4. scp _site/* <your prod host>

## Contributing

Don't. Please, just contribute to a project worth your while. 

## Tutorial

In case you're wondering, the official Jekyll tutorial I've followed along to create this gem of penguinism is found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/).
