title: The penguins' quest for world domination
---

Penguins are - according to encyclopedias - peaceful, flightless birds that waddle, look cute and are, occasionally, funny. 

What you probably don't know is that penguins have secretly been training and preparing for world domination. Under the guise of global warming, they have spread across all the southern hemisphere and due to their harmless appearance and cute looks, have infiltrated the northern hemisphere in the form of local cells.

Spread across the globe like this and networked through both satellite comms (with implants) and internet lines (with concealed devices), they coordinate their activity to take out the most powerful people in the world and replace them by highly sophisticated duplicates (three penguins in a trenchcoat). 

It is unknown how many of the world's leaders were replaced, however, the increasing amount of penguins within our society and in positions of extreme power is a growing concern.
