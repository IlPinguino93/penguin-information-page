Penguinism is the idea that the world should be run by penguins. This marginalized political belief is held by 0.01 % of humanity and 99.9 % of penguins (allowing for a 0.1 % margin of error each). 

How this should work and how humans would be treated in this case is often unclear. Most penguins (and human penguinists) believe that living alongside humans is possible, as long as they adopt a reasonable world view (with less destructive environmental policies and acceptance of the new penguin overlords). Some however, advocate the adoption of humans (analogue to the Dimma in Islam) or even outright genocide. 

A minority of penguinists however believes that humans can be brought to reason without actually openly taking over, just by replacing some key figures and planting some agents of their own. This view of penguinism gains more and more followers, as humans tend to follow whoever takes charge without second thought, as shown by several penguinese studies.
